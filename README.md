For people who love retro gaming...your in luck, I put together all my favorite games on recalbox so you can download it on a usb. Recalbox is already on it.

I have personally played these games myself, I do suggest going to recalbox.com to find out how to put these roms on a usb.
-I used balena etcher to flash my usb 
-I bought a 165 GB micro sd card to put in my raspberry pi.(You can use other OS and emultors also)
-I downloaded the recalbox OS on the micro sd I flashed.
-I ran the recalbox emulator, plugged in the USB and messed around with settings until I shut it off. 
-Once you turn it back on(Assuming the usb is still in) and then turn it back on, there will be files downloaded to your usb.
-There are lots of tutorials online, I reccommend going to recalbox.com to figure it out. feel free to start a discussion on this and @mention me!
